# TrumpTwitterAnalysis

Abstract
-----------------------------------

As more people get their news primarily from Twitter, it is important to analyze how people engage with tweets differently, and how politicians can manipulate their tweets to receive more engagement. During the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump in particular made use of Twitter as a platform to further his campaign and other political messages, so we chose to use him as the base for our engagement prediction. We trained models on Donald Trump's tweets to predict the number of favorites and retweets that a tweet might get based on information about the tweeter and the tweet itself. We then retrained models using different people's tweets to see if there are correlations between certain types of people on Twitter and the amount of engagement they receive. We compared our models to a bag of words model, and expanded our corpus by replacing URLs with the titles of the respective web pages. Overall, we found that Trump and other Republicans, including his campaign members, were good predictors for the number of favorites and retweets his tweets get, suggesting that people were interested in his political messages, and that attempting to manipulate engagement is not successful without an interesting platform.
